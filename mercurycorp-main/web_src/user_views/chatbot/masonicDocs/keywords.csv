Keyword,Definition
Fall,"Unintentional change in position coming to rest on the ground, floor, or onto a lower surface. The fall may be witnessed, reported by the resident or an observer, or identified when a resident is found on the floor or ground. Falls are NOT a result of an overwhelming external force (resident pushing another resident). An intercepted fall occurs when a resident would have fallen if he or she had not caught him/herself or had not been intercepted by another person-this is still a fall."
